Hello world! Welcome to my blog!

I'm probably going to post a variety of things here, with reposts on tumblr.

Here is a test for code:

```rust
fn add_people(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.spawn((Person, Name("Elaina Proctor".to_string())));
    commands.spawn((Person, Name("Renzo Hume".to_string())));
    commands.spawn((Person, Name("Zayna Nieves".to_string())));
}
```
