Alright so, time to actually put this blog into use!

Since I made my first small-web site I've learned a lot, and have since learned about svelte and other web-technologies that I want to experiment with!

The first step was to change domains: as much as I love atelierwy.ch, I realized it was pretty redundent since wychwit.ch was going unused.

My first decision was to redo the pallet! I used [realtimecolors.com](https://realtimecolors.com/) to generate some, and I adjusted the results slightly afterwards!
<Palette palettes={palettes} />

What's really fun about sveltekit, is that instead of creating those palletes one by one, I created a component and passed a list of them directly in! It was as easy as, well, this! 

```md
<Palette palettes={palettes} />
```
I will edit this later, rn prism.js is NOT scrolling for some reason.
